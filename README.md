# Cat Pomodoro

A website that makes studying fun by being a pomodoro timer and a cat collection game combined. The more the user studies, the more cats they can collect. There is a 25 minute timer for studying followed by a five minute break following the pomodoro study cycle. After cats get unlocked users can click them to see the cat's happiness score go up.
